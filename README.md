# [tanselberkant.dev][website]

My own personal website, designed to serve as a dynamic platform for sharing my blog posts, showcasing my constantly updated resume, and providing information about my projects in a dashboard format. The site was built from scratch using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity, reflecting my commitment to staying up-to-date with modern web development technologies.
